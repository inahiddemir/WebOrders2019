How to rerun failed tests?
    answer: There are many ways, and the easiest one is to add following parameter into maven-surefire plugin configuration:
    <rerunFailingTestsCount>1</rerunFailingTestsCount>
    or, with cucumber, we can generate txt file with failed test scenarios, and then run those scenarios in dedicated test runner class that calls FailedRunner.
Build periodically:
H 5 * * 1-5 | Run smoke test from Monday to Friday, every day around 5 am
H 23 25 12 * | Run on December 25 at 11 PM
H(0-59) * * * * | Run every minute
